# OCR_Resnet

![python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6%2C3.7%2C3.8-blue?logo=python)

- This is my implementation of an OCR using Resnet. 

- Resnet is one of the best Neural Network architectures for image classification and it's biggest advantage is the fact that as the network depth increases, it cancels negative outcomes.

- I have used the MNIST dataset for numbers and A_Z dataset from Kaggle for the letters.

- Accuracy is around 96%

- To run the model:
```
$ python ocr_handwriting.py --model handwriting.model --image images/umbc_address.png
```
